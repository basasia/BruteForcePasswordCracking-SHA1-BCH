# BruteForcePasswordCracking-SHA1-BCH
Application for cracking the 6 digits character or BCH (10,6) that are hashed by SHA1, developed by using Python

###Brute force cracking app for 6 digits character or BCH(10,6) code that are hashed by SHA1

##Task

Build an application that can be used for cracking the SHA1 hashed passwords of BCH(10,6) code or 6 digits character.

##Summary 

This application was built using Python. It is a very easy programming language to use for developing a basic application, which allows user to easily install libraries needed. Thus, this app was implemented using Python for both the main functionality and front-end part.

##Functionality

This application allows the users to input the hashed passwords of BCH(10,6) code or 6 digits character, then the program will run through all possible combinations of password within the domain. Once the result is found, the program will terminate and display the readable original password.

##Design

The design of this app consits of two main parts which are module for cracking 6 digits character and module for cracking BCH (10,6).   

##Run Locally

- Clone the folder BruteForcePasswordCracking-SHA1-BCH
- Make sure to install Python
- Run the  file \BruteForcePasswordCracking-SHA1-BCH\Brute Force Password Cracking.py
- Optionally, the input hased password can be modified within Brute Force Password Cracking.py  

##Tech Stack

- Python

Required libraries:

- functools
- hashlib
- random
- itertools
